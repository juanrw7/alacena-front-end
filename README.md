Alacena was created because we have a passion for cooking and great food.  Alacena is a tool to help you make a decision of the daily question 'what are we eating?' by offering 20 random recipes per day for the user based on which meal is chosen.  A user can also search for recipes by entering in what ingredients they have at home to cook with.
